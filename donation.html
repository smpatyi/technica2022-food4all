        automatically deducted from your account on a regular basis. You can
        choose from a daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or annual recurrence.
        The major benefit of recurring donations is that you can spread out your
        donation! For example, if you want to donate $240 every year to
        food4all, but it’s not feasible to donate that at one time, you can
        spread it out into 12 monthly donations of $20.</span

        >Make a massive impact for one student experiencing long-term food
        insecurity. You’ll be paired with a single student, who you’ll sponsor
        throughout college. By selecting this donation option, you agree to a
        4-year sponsorship (paid either monthly or yearly). Sponsorships
        automatically end after 4 years. If your student does not complete their
        education within 4 years, you will not be obligated to continue the
        sponsorship. For security purposes, all student identities will remain
        anonymous. </span
